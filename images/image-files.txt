# Example HTML snippets (copy-paste)
# 1) Logo (links to homepage)
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="Jack Sams logo" class="site-logo">

# 2) Headshot (portrait)
<img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot of Jack Sams" width="200" height="200">

# 3) Responsive screenshot with alt
<img src="images/portfolio-responsive-app.jpg" alt="Screenshot of responsive portfolio web app" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">

# 4) Using srcset for performance (replace filenames with your optimized files)
<img src="images/headshot.jpg"
     srcset="images/headshot-small.webp 400w, images/headshot.jpg 800w"
     sizes="(max-width:600px) 200px, 400px"
     alt="Headshot of Jack Sams">

# Guidance:
# - Include at least 4 images total (logo + 3 others) as required by the checklist.
# - Make alt text concise and descriptive; include keywords only when it is genuinely descriptive (e.g., "screenshot of portfolio project: responsive web app").
# - Keep decorative images' alt empty (alt="") so screen readers skip them.
# - Use descriptive filenames (good for SEO): e.g., jack-sams-headshot.jpg, portfolio-responsive-app.jpg
# - Provide WebP versions for smaller file sizes and use srcset to serve them to supporting browsers.
